if we create a variable "let x = 5", we can not change it with "x=3", but we can "shadow" it as such: "let x = 5; let x = x + 1", and we can even change the type (i.e String -> int)

LOOK AT main.rs IN VARIABLES
LOOK AT main.rs IN OWNERSHIP

At any given time, you can have either one mutable reference or any number of immutable references.
References must always be valid.

let slice = &s[0..2]; == let slice = &s[..2];
let slice = &s[3..len]; == let slice = &s[3..];
let slice = &s[0..len]; == let slice = &s[..];

"x.push_str(y)" pushes y string onto x string
"x.push(y)" pushes a character y onto x string

let s1 = String::from("Hello, ");
let s2 = String::from("world!");
let s3 = s1 + &s2; // note s1 has been moved here and can no longer be used
